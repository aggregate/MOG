20101122 alpha test release


This is a ***VERY*** preliminary alpha test release of the MIPS-based MOG.
We do not suggest that it is useful for anything but getting a feel for how
the system works, and THIS VERSION SHOULD NOT BE REDISTRIBUTED, but it will
soon be followed by a useful version.

The original MOG versions were all based on a stack instruction set, which
proved too difficult for other compilers to target. There were about 70K
lines of source code in that system -- and about two dozen different
versions trying a wide variety of optimization methods.  Some of the best
of the methods tried are reported in our LCPC 2009 paper:

http://www.springerlink.com/content/x3k8k3uw7j42j553/

For now, that's the reference to cite.

The best of those methods is essentially what the new system implements;
a series of single-instruction interpreters using an ordering that is
automatically optimized for each application. However, unlike the version
reported in the LCPC paper, this release uses static analysis rather than
a runtime trace to collect instruction frequency and pairwise adjacency.
The optimizer is greatly simplified too.

Like the earlier versions, the MOG interpreter itself is quite simple,
complicated mostly by a 3-dimensional global memory layout that ensures
all memory references are free of bank conflicts while avoiding the
integer multiply that the obvious 2D layout would have needed for the
address computations.

The new MOG instruction set is accumulator based with general registers.
This is a very effective model, allowing the accumulator to reside in an
actual GPU register and dramatically simplifying instruction decoding.
The "registers" are actually stored in local "shared" memory, again with
a layout that ensures freedom from banking conflicts, and the compiler's
effective use of registers thus produces good explicit management of the
very scarce GPU local memory.

The system currently does not support double-precision floats, because
we strongly believe it is a mistake to use them (due to a memory layout
that breaks the banking properties). For several years, we have had
libraries that facilitate use of pairs of native floats instead.

There is also now a framework for passing system calls between the GPU and
the host. Just as a proof of concept as well as some system testing purposes, 
we have provided support for some basic file I/O, which only requires the 
inclusion of a special 'mog_syscall' header and footer(see test.c/iotest.c
for examples).

We are currently working on an OpenCL backend.

INSTALLING THE SYSTEM
Depending on your system, this may be very difficult. I recommend using arch; 
there is a regularly updated cuda build in the official repo, and working cross 
compilers in the AUR

1. Install a c->mipsel cross compiler, then change the name in the
   in the cross compiler invocation at the top of mogcc to your binary
	 name.

2. Compile mogas.  Just cc mogas.c -o mogas.

3. Install CUDA on your system, then change the CUDA_INSTALL_PATH
   variable in the Makefile to your install path. We have tested the 
	 current system on various CUDA versions between 4.0-6.5.

Note: Though not strictly necessary, you may also want to change the 
GPU_MULTIPROCESSORS, GPU_WARPSIZE and GPU_THREADSPERBLOCK definitions at the top 
of mog.cu to match your system.

RUNNING THE SYSTEM

Given all that, the program test.c, which includes some basic file I/O,
can be compiled into test.as by:

./mogcc test.c >test.as

This actually runs GCC for MIPSEL and then translates the MIPS code into
our MOG instruction set using a series of sed/awk scripts. It's ugly, but
GCC MIPSEL seems to have a lot of imaginary instructions in its output,
so a better translator is postponed until we know what the full scope of
instructions emitted by GCC MIPSEL is. There is a fair amount of stuff
spewed to stderr while doing this.

The next step is to run the assembler to generate the data files that
will be compiled into the simulator. For that, simply:

./mogas <test.as >mog.h

The mog.h name is critical, because it gets compiled into the interpreter.

To build the executable MOG, just type make. 

iotest.c similarly tests some basic file I/O.

If the TRACE flag is set,
you'll get a tracer; otherwise, you get execution that executes many
instructions per kernel invocation. Simply run:

CREDIT (BLAME?)

Except for the .deb files, this code was written by H. Dietz. It is
free software, but should NOT be redistributed at this time. Thus,
consider it as being copyrighted with that restriction for now, although
we will soon change the status to public domain or an attribution-style
copyright. We have no long-term intention of preventing anyone from using
this system in any context, including incorporating it under commercial
products.

As for most of our freely available source code, we make no claims of
usability, etc., for this system. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Later versions
may have some level of support, but this 20101122 release should be seen
as a "toy" to let people see what we're doing... so they know we're
serious about MOG and that it really does work.
